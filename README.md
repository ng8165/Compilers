# Compiler_Gou

This repository contains my work for Harker's ATCS Compilers and Interpreters course.

The labs are as follows:
1. [Scanner Lab](https://github.com/ng8165/Compilers/blob/main/labs/ScannerLab.pdf): files are stored in the `Compiler_Gou/src/scanner` package.
2. JFlex Lab: The objective was to use [JFlex](https://jflex.de/) to generate a scanner for any language. I generated a scanner for an RSS feed. The project can be found under the `Scanner_JFlex/src` folder.
3. [Parser Lab](https://github.com/ng8165/Compilers/blob/main/labs/ParserLab.pdf): files are stored in the `Compiler_Gou/src/parser` package.
4. [AST Lab](https://github.com/ng8165/Compilers/blob/main/labs/ASTLab.pdf): files are stored in the `Compiler_Gou/src/ast` package and the `Compiler_Gou/src/environment` package.
5. [Procedures Lab](https://github.com/ng8165/Compilers/blob/main/labs/ProcedureLab.pdf): modifications were made to many packages.
6. [MIPS Lab](https://github.com/ng8165/Compilers/blob/main/labs/MIPSLab.pdf): files are stored under the `mips` folder. See `simple.asm`, `helloworld.asm`, `multiplication.asm`, `evenodd.asm`, `loop.asm`, `userGuess.asm`, `compGuess.asm`, and `arraystats.asm`.
7. [Code Generation Lab](https://github.com/ng8165/Compilers/blob/main/labs/CodeGenLab.pdf): modifications were made to the `Compiler_Gou/src/ast` package and the `Compiler_Gou/src/emitter` package.
8. [Subroutines Lab](https://github.com/ng8165/Compilers/blob/main/labs/SubroutineLab.pdf): files are stored under the `mips` folder. See `max2.asm`, `max3.asm`, `fact.asm`, `fib.asm`, and `listnode.asm`.
9. [Compiling Procedures Lab](https://github.com/ng8165/Compilers/blob/main/labs/CompilingProceduresLab.pdf): modifications were made to the `Compiler_Gou/src/ast` package and the `Compiler_Gou/src/emitter` package.
