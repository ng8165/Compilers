<title>Virginia parents appeal to remove a so-called anti-racist policy from school district: 'Racist at its core'</title>
<description>Virginia parents and students represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom argued in court Tuesday to appeal a so-called anti-racist school policy implemented in their county.</description>
<content:encoded><p>Virginia parents are continuing to fight back after a school board implemented an "anti-racism" policy in their<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank"> children's school</a> district that they say treats children unequally and is "racist at its core."</p> <p>Five families in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/virginia" target="_blank">Virginia's Albemarle County</a> are suing the school board after it passed a wide-reaching anti-racism policy in 2019 for all schools in the district from elementary to high school. In their complaint, the plaintiffs allege the curriculum "indoctrinates children" in Critical Race Theory, and violates their civil rights. The parents say the district will not allow students to opt out of the curriculum.</p> <p>Alliance Defending Freedom argued on behalf of these "racially and religiously diverse" families at the<i> </i>Court of Appeals in Virginia, Tuesday. The families are appealing a 2022 ruling to dismiss the case. </p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/parents-defending-education-leader-chinese-communist-influence-american-schools-deeply-concerning" target="_blank"><strong>PARENTS DEFENDING EDUCATION LEADER SAYS CHINESE COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON AMERICAN SCHOOLS IS ‘DEEPLY CONCERNING</strong>’</a></p> <p>"Bigotry cannot be defeated by more bigotry, but the Albemarle County School Board’s policy forces students to judge everyone and everything through the lens of race," ADF's suit says. "This violates these parents’ and children’s deeply held religious beliefs about the dignity and humanity of every person. Children should not be forced to say that the color of their skin defines them and their future, and schools should not be hiding their ideological classroom practices from parents."</p> <p>Kate Anderson, senior counsel for ADF, described some of the activities students were required to participate in during the pilot program, such as being asked to raise their hands and identify their "privilege" to fellow students.</p> <p>In another activity, they were asked to write down characteristics of the "oppressor" and "oppressed" classes.</p> <p>"And so what went in that box were "White, Christian male," and then they were supposed to metaphorically break that box," she told Fox News Digital. The attorney said students were also asked to create a vision statement of how they were going to change themselves to become more anti-racist.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/elite-nyc-private-schools-make-parents-sign-anti-racist-commitment-attend-anti-racist-training" target="_blank"><strong>ELITE NYC PRIVATE SCHOOLS MAKE PARENTS SIGN ‘ANTI-RACIST’ COMMITMENT, ATTEND ‘ANTI-RACIST TRAINING’</strong></a></p> <p>"And <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rhode-island-mom-sues-school-after-discovering-secret-antiracist-meetings" target="_blank">anti-racist is really</a> code for adopting fully the CRT-based policy that views everyone through the lens of race. And students were instructed in class that if they were silent, that supported the most egregious forms of racism, so that they had to adopt this ideology and incorporate it into their lives and announce that to their classroom in order to be in alignment with the policy," she added.</p> <p>Plaintiffs provided documents from the program that call comments about a "colorblind or "post-racial society," or that "it doesn't matter who you vote for," examples of racism to avoid. The plaintiffs argued the policy "threatens to silence" dissenters of the curriculum, by implementing "restorative justice" when a student commits an act of racism.</p> <p>"When school administrators determine a student has committed a racist act, the student will be provided the opportunity to learn about the impact of their actions on others through such practices as restorative justice, mediation, role play or other explicit policies or training resources," <a href="https://esb.k12albemarle.org/Reference_Library/ESB_Policies_and_Regulations/Policies//ACC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the school policy states</a>.</p> <p>The Albemarle County School Board denied they were teaching Critical Race Theory, in <a href="https://www.k12albemarle.org/school-board/school-board-statement-july-12-2021" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a past statement.</a><a rel="nofollow"> ADF argues the policy does teach the ideology. </a></p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-is-critical-race-theory" target="_blank"><strong><u>WHAT IS CRITICAL RACE THEORY?</u></strong></a></p> <p>"The policy is labeled an anti-racism policy, but in fact what the policy does is it incorporates critical theory ideology that promotes race-based division and race-based resentment," ADF lawyer Ryan Bangert <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/virginia-school-district-indoctrinating-critical-race-theory-parents-lawsuit" target="_blank">previously told Fox News Digital</a>. "It redefines the concept of racism to include having opinions that don’t align with the race-based indoctrination program of the policy and the curriculum. Even worse, it labels dissent from that program as racist."</p> <p>The legal group argued the school district was being discriminatory against students and parents who object to these ideologies in the classroom.</p> <p>"Every student deserves to be treated equally under the law, regardless of race or religion. Public schools can’t impose demeaning stereotypes on students based on these characteristics," ADF Senior Counsel Vincent Wagner said in a statement. </p> <p>"Parents have the fundamental right to know what their kids are being taught in public schools and to protect them from policies and curriculum that compel them to affirm harmful ideologies. We urge the court to take a hard look at the school board’s discriminatory policy," he added.</p> <p>Albemarle County School District declined to comment on the pending litigation but reiterated they "strongly support the School Board's anti-racism policy."</p> <p>They referred Fox News Digital to their previous statement made after last year's court decision in their favor, saying the court "agreed with our position that plaintiffs failed to show concrete harm to students from the (anti-racism) policy's implementation."</p> <p>In a statement on their website, Albemarle County Public Schools said the district "is committed to establishing and sustaining an equitable community that achieves the School Division's ​equity mission to ​end the predictive value of race and ensure each individual student's and staff's success. ​The Albemarle County S​chool Board and School Division reject all forms of racism as destructive to their mission, vision, values and goals.​​​"</p> <p><i><strong>For more Culture, Media, Education, Opinion, and channel coverage, visit </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank"><i><strong><u>foxnews.com/media.</u></strong></i></a></p></content:encoded>

<title>Chicago teachers union boss picks better school for her son, but not yours</title>
<description>Stacy Davis Gates, president of Chicago Teachers Union and staunch opponent of school choice, now sends her son to a private Catholic school.</description>
<content:encoded><p>The president of the Chicago Teachers Union and executive vice president of the American Federation of Teachers, Stacy Davis Gates, confirmed that she now sends her eldest son to a private school.</p> <p>Local journalists initially reported that MaxPreps, a website devoted to tracking high school sports, listed her son on the soccer team at De La Salle Institute, a private Catholic school boasting a 96 percent college attendance rate among its former students.</p> <p>Admins of a private Facebook group of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/teachers" target="_blank">Chicago Teachers Union members </a>shortly thereafter mentioned that they had become aware of the news three weeks prior and that they "dislike the hypocrisy of CTU when they have gone after people who made the same choice."</p> <p>It should go without saying, but Mrs. Gates is a fierce opponent of school choice, at least when it comes to other people’s children. Just last year, she posted that "school choice was actually the choice of racists" and that school choice has "racist origins." Her union she represents has consistently taken a hardline stance against private school choice programs.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chicago-teachers-union-boss-denounced-school-choice-racist-has-son-catholic-school-report" target="_blank"><strong>CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION BOSS WHO DENOUNCED SCHOOL CHOICE AS RACIST HAS SON IN CATHOLIC SCHOOL</strong></a></p> <p>Most recently, Chicago Teachers Union opposed the state’s Invest in Kids Tax Credit Scholarship Program for low-income students, which Illinois Democrats killed this year. For the leader of the union to turn around and exercise the same choice her union and its representatives in the legislature just eliminated for poor families is a slap in the face to families who do not have the means Mrs. Gates does.</p> <p>In an interview with Chicago Magazine last year, Mrs. Gates said "I can't advocate on behalf of public education without it taking root in my own household." At the time, she sent all three of her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/chicago" target="_blank">children to Chicago Public Schools</a>. Well, that didn’t last long.</p> <p>Mrs. Gates made about $150,000 in total compensation as vice president of Chicago Teachers Union in 2022, according to the Center for Union Facts. Presumably, as the union’s new president, she makes more than she did last year, and perhaps now has enough money to cover her son’s $14,750 private school tuition.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION</u></strong></a></p> <p>Good for her. I’m glad her family has that opportunity. But why shouldn’t all families have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education" target="_blank">access to an education</a> that best meets their needs? Why does she pay out of pocket to send her own son to a non-unionized private school if her union does such a fantastic job at ensuring a good education for kids in Chicago Public Schools?</p> <p>Mrs. Gates shouldn’t fight against school choice for less advantaged families who are currently stuck in Chicago’s failing government schools. The latest Illinois state assessments reveal only 17% of Chicago Public School students are proficient in math (and 26% in reading).</p> <p>According WBEZ Chicago, the union president said her decision to send her son to a private school "represents a stark statement about disinvestment in public schools." That flimsy defense is garbage, however, as these failure factories spend over $29,000 per student per year, about twice as much as the her son’s private school tuition.</p> <p>Mrs. Gates issued a statement attempting to defend her hypocrisy. In it, she admits that "If you are a Black family living in a Black community, high-quality neighborhood schools have been the dream, not the reality." She goes on to say that the government schools are so bad that it ultimately "forced" her to choose a private school.</p> <p>She knows the Chicago Public School system is a complete dumpster fire that failed her son and so many others. Why should any kids, particularly ones from low-income families, be trapped in those failing institutions that are staffed by her union?</p> <p>In her letter, Mrs. Gates quadruples down on her hypocrisy by saying that her and her union won’t stop fighting against school choice for others. "We will continue to oppose siphoning public school resources off to private institutions through voucher programs," she said. She must realize that her decision to pull her own son out of his assigned government school diverts resources away from it just as much as a school choice initiative allegedly does, as government schools are funded based on enrollment counts.</p> <p>She concludes her statement by mentioning she and her union "will fight against destructive and racist school closings that have left a trail of devastation in Black and Brown communities." Her hypocrisy knows no bounds. This is coming from the same union that, in December 2020, deleted a tweet saying "the push to reopen schools is rooted in sexism, racism and misogyny."</p> <p>Around that same time, a Chicago Teachers Union board member was caught vacationing in Puerto Rico while saying it was too dangerous to reopen schools and go back to work in person. The union posted an embarrassing interpretive dance video to protest reopening, and even went on strike in 2022, forcing schools to close again. Chicago Teachers Union is a total clown show.</p> <p>Progressives like Mrs. Gates are hypocrites because their salaries depend on it. Her job as a union boss is to protect the government school monopoly at all costs, and giving families a choice would force her members to compete.</p> <p>Democrat politicians like President Joe Biden, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker all demonstrate the same hypocrisy – even though most of their constituents support school choice – because they are owned by the teachers' unions. The National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, the nation’s largest teachers' unions, funneled over 99% of their campaign contributions to Democrats in 2022.</p> <p>All families, regardless of income, should have the power to take their children’s state-funded education dollars to the public or private school of their choice. At a fraction of the cost of what the government schools spend on dooming so many Chicago children to a life of poverty, this opportunity would be a game changer, giving them a real shot at success.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/d/corey-deangelis" target="_blank"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY COREY DEANGELIS</u></strong></a></p></content:encoded>

<title>MSNBC's Jen Psaki primetime gamble has experts questioning liberal network's strategy, Chris Hayes' future</title>
<description>Experts address MSNBC&apos;s &quot;unusual&quot; programming strategy giving newcomer host Jen Psaki a primetime slot on Mondays, replacing network veteran Chris Hayes.</description>
<content:encoded><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank">MSNBC made headlines</a> last week with its announcement that its newest host, former Biden White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, is already getting promoted by expanding her role beyond Sunday afternoons and into primetime on Mondays. </p> <p>Psaki, who officially joined the network in May 2022 after leaving the Biden administration, will be taking over MSNBC's 8 p.m. ET time slot on Monday nights later this month, replacing "All In with Chris Hayes" which will now only air Tuesday through Friday. MSNBC has noted that Hayes' show has used rotating hosts on Monday nights, including Psaki, over the past year while he works on other projects.</p> <p>The move follows MSNBC's surprising programming decision last year to have its biggest star, Rachel Maddow, only host on Mondays and giving her 9 p.m. ET time slot to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbcs-alex-wagner-tonight-struggles-fill-gaping-ratings-void-left-rachel-maddow" target="_blank">Alex Wagner</a> for the remainder of the week. Maddow re-upped with the network in 2021 for a reported $30 million annual deal.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/psaki-torn-claiming-supports-abortion-birth-worked-man" target="_blank"><strong>PSAKI TORN APART FOR CLAIMING ‘NO ONE’ SUPPORTS ABORTION THROUGH BIRTH: ‘YOU WORKED FOR THE MAN WHO DOES!’</strong></a></p> <p>Fox News contributor Joe Concha told Fox News Digital that for MSNBC to alter only its primetime lineup on Monday is "profoundly stupid," saying either Psaki should be in primetime every weeknight or none at all. </p> <p>"Viewers want consistency," Concha said. "And for MSNBC to offer these half-baked lineups doesn't allow for that."</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/psaki-hypes-trump-indictment-book-club-assignment-encourage-friends-neighbors-read" target="_blank"><strong>PSAKI HYPES TRUMP INDICTMENT AS BOOK CLUB ASSIGNMENT: ‘ENCOURAGE YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS TO READ IT’</strong></a></p> <p>DePauw University journalism professor Jeffrey McCall saw the move as "unusual" but suggested to Fox News Digital that MSNBC is willing to take the gamble and create a "blockbuster Monday" to draw Democratic viewers to the network with the help of "two high-profile progressive women" like Psaki and Maddow, adding that Psaki will likely get a ratings boost for being in the same lineup as the popular TV liberal. </p> <p>"We're heading into primetime election season, and we're heading into the Trump trials and all that stuff is going to be red meat for the progressives who watch MSNBC," McCall said. "And [they'll] be happy to see back-to-back high personality women beating up on Trump, for example, and promoting Democratic causes." </p> <p>During Psaki's final months as press secretary, it was reported that MSNBC had engaged in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-cnn-psaki" target="_blank">a bidding war</a> against CNN, where Psaki was previously a commentator in the lead-up to the 2020 election. Following weeks of rumors about her future plans, MSNBC announced Psaki would join the network as a political analyst and a host on the Peacock streaming service. Clearly, MSNBC's plans for Psaki have shifted in favor of a traditional cable news program. </p> <p>"Inside with Jen Psaki," which launched in March of this year, quickly became MSNBC's highest-rated Sunday program, averaging roughly 840,000 viewers in recent months. But her takeover on Monday could spell trouble for Hayes.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/politifact-jen-psaki-false-biden-inflation" target="_blank"><strong>POLITIFACT GIVES JEN PSAKI ‘FALSE’ RATING OVER CLAIM ‘NO ECONOMIST’ BELIEVES BIDEN AGENDA WILL FUEL INFLATION</strong></a></p> <p>"Chris Hayes should be nervous," NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News Digital. "MSNBC can insist Chris Hayes remains a valuable part of the network and will be going forward, but if that’s the case, why then was Jen Psaki given a night at his expense?"</p> <p>Concha offered a similar sentiment, saying Hayes as an MSNBC veteran should be "insulted" that management is pulling one of his nights and giving it to someone who joined the network's programming "a few months ago." </p> <p>Hayes has hosted "All In" since 2013 and, while never a ratings dynamo, has been one of the faces of its left-leaning political coverage.</p> <p>Hayes has seen a drop in his viewership, losing nearly a tenth of total viewers since 2021, averaging 1.4 million viewers and shedding over a quarter of viewers in the coveted 25-54 age demographic which advertisers prioritize.</p> <p>McCall pointed out that while Hayes has his own fan base as a longtime MSNBC fixture, Psaki is a "darling of the Democratic Party" for her years serving in both the Obama and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden" target="_blank">Biden administrations</a>. </p> <p>If Psaki draws a larger audience, it could create a conundrum for the network involving Hayes.</p> <p>"Chris Hayes is a loyal soldier of the MSNBC approach to journalism. He takes on all the right issues. He's got all the right positions. But in reality, his ratings have never really taken off," McCall said. "I would think he probably can't help but look at this as maybe a threat coming over the horizon, and I would think he's probably looking over his shoulder because if Psaki's ratings really take off at that time slot, 8:00, I can't imagine MSNBC wouldn't be thinking about, ‘OK, where do we reposition Chris and maybe leave Jen in this slot?’"</p> <p>"If she's doing well, the evidence is going to be right there. And it's all about numbers… If Jen Psaki gets them an extra half a million viewers per night, those numbers are going to talk rather than loyalty," he added.</p> <p>MSNBC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p><i><strong>For more Culture, Media, Education, Opinion, and channel coverage, visit </strong></i><a href="http://foxnews.com/media" target="_blank"><i><strong><u>foxnews.com/media</u></strong></i></a></p></content:encoded>

He would sleep with my daughter, Callie," he added.</p> <p>But Minion was also very curious.</p> <p>One day when the backyard gate was accidentally left open — Minion got out.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/missing-cat-found-6-year-search-owner-peabody-community" target="_blank"><strong><u>MISSING CAT FOUND AFTER AN EXTENSIVE 6-YEAR SEARCH BY HIS OWNER AND LOCAL COMMUNITY</u></strong></a></p> <p>"He and our other dog at the time ran out," Skip Crandall said. </p> <p>"One came back and the other did not," he said.</p> <p>The Crandalls said they <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/dogs-cats-roam-free-first-cageless-animal-shelter-us-opens-arkansas" target="_blank">scoured the shelters,</a> put up signs and asked neighbors to help look for Minion, with no luck. </p> <p>"It definitely was super sad," Callie Crandall, a 20-year-old college student, told Fox News Digital. </p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/utah-horse-returns-home-owner-8-years-running-wild-mustangs-miracle" target="_blank"><strong>UTAH HORSE RETURNS HOME TO OWNER AFTER 8 YEARS OF RUNNING WITH WILD MUSTANGS: 'IT’S A MIRACLE'</strong></a></p> <p>"He was so playful and loved to sleep on my bed. We had a special bond," she said.</p> <p>But after a month went by, the Crandalls began to lose hope. </p> <p>"We thought the chances were slim that we would ever see him again," Skip Crandall said.

I didn't even think that was possible, to have all that time go by and the dog's still here. I told him, ‘The dog's still registered to your name so you can take your dog back. But I know it has been 12 years, so I know life has probably changed," Sanford said.</p> <p>Skip Crandall made a quick call to his wife to tell her the news — and then called Sanford back right away to find out how they could get Minion back.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/missing-dog-rings-doorbell-south-carolina-fireworks" target="_blank"><strong>MISSING PET DOG RETURNS HOME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND RINGS FAMILY'S DOORBELL: 'WE WERE FREAKING OUT'</strong></a></p> <p>"Officer Sanford actually drove 20 or 22 miles or something out of the way to bring him back directly to our home so that he wouldn't have to go through processing or anything," Skip Crandall said. </p> <p>Before she <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/house-and-home" target="_blank">arrived at the house,</a> Sanford reminded Skip Crandall that his dog was 15 years old now — and not to expect the same playful puppy they once knew, she recalled.</p> <p>"He’s old, he's slow," Sanford said.

So that was pretty neat."</p> <p>Sanford reinforced that notion.</p> <p>"Absolutely microchip your pets 100%," she said. </p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/nevada-dog-lived-months-pack-wild-coyotes-rescued-sweetest-loving-dog" target="_blank"><strong><u>NEVADA PUPPY LEFT FOR DEAD IN DESERT BUILT LIFE AMONG PACK OF WILD COYOTES BEFORE CAPTURE: RESCUERS</u></strong></a></p> <p>"It's pretty cost-effective. Usually most places, like $20 to $30. Most shelters have microchip events sometimes, like we do at our Maricopa County shelter. And keep them updated if you move, if you change your phone number. If I hadn’t had a phone number to call, they probably would never have seen it online because who would be looking online for their dog that's been gone for 12 years."</p> <p>Sanford also said it was nice to be part of a happy reunion. "We do have a lot of hard cases, so it's really nice to have ‘return to owner’ situations in the field," she said. </p> <p>"But this one just kind of just blew me out of the water. It was such a cool experience to be part of, just to see that Minion was back home and I could tell that he was back home."</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p> <p>As for Minion — Skip Crandall said he’s fitting in just fine.</p> <p>"We taught him how to use the dog door already, so he's going in and out again," he said. </p> <p>"He likes to go on car rides and hang his head out the window just like any dog. So we're excited to have him back and he'll <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/senior-dog-california-verge-being-euthanized-adopted-beats-cancer" target="_blank">have some good years</a> here with us."</p></content:encoded>

<title>Beverly Hills Police Department accused of racially profiling over 1,000 Black people in the wealthy CA city</title>
<description>A lawsuit is accusing California’s Beverly Hills Police Department of racially profiling a thousand Black motorists in the wealthy, predominantly White city.</description>
<content:encoded><p>A lawsuit accuses <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" target="_blank">Beverly Hills</a> police of racially profiling nearly 1,100 Black people during traffic stops.</p> <p>The suit announced Monday was filed on behalf of most of the Black drivers who were pulled over in the wealthy city between August 2019 and August 2021.</p> <p>Out of a total of 1,088 Black motorists stopped, only two were convicted of crimes, attorney Benjamin Crump said at a news conference.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/5-white-nationalist-hate-group-members-convicted-conspiracy-riot-id-pride-event" target="_blank"><strong><u>5 WHITE NATIONALIST HATE GROUP MEMBERS CONVICTED OF CONSPIRACY TO RIOT AT ID PRIDE EVENT</u></strong></a></p> <p>About a third of all arrests made during the period involved Blacks, who make up only 1.5% of the city's population, Crump said.</p> <p>"It wasn’t to deter crime. It was to send a message to Black people that we don’t want your kind around here," Crump said. "That is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/hate-crime" target="_blank">racial profiling</a> 101!"</p> <p>The city denied the allegations, saying in a statement, "The statistics presented referencing the number of convictions is a mischaracterization of the evidence in this case. In addition, the 1,088 arrests referenced includes people cited and released, not just custodial arrests."</p> <p>"The City of Beverly Hills is an international destination that always welcomes visitors from across the country and around the world," it said. "The role of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank">Beverly Hills Police Department</a> is to enforce the law, regardless of race."</p> <p>The suit seeks $500 million in damages.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/alabama-woman-who-hung-racially-offensive-dolls-black-neigbhors-fence-gets-year-behind-bars" target="_blank"><strong>ALABAMA WOMAN, WHO HUNG RACIALLY OFFENSIVE DOLLS ON BLACK NEIGBHORS’ FENCE, GETS A YEAR BEHIND BARS</strong></a></p> <p>Law clerk Shepherd York was was one of the people who were pulled over, for having expired license plates as he was driving to work, attorneys said.</p> <p>"I spent three days in jail," York said at the news conference. "Humiliated, scared, sad."</p> <p>His car was searched and impounded, but he was never convicted of a crime, attorneys said.</p></content:encoded>

<title>Hospital patient confesses decades-old crime to nurse: police</title>
<description>A Wisconsin hospital patient told his nurse that he was the suspect in the unsolved murder of Terry Dolowy, whose charred and decapitated remains were found in 1985.</description>
<content:encoded><p>A patient in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/wisconsin" target="_blank">a Wisconsin</a> hospital told his nurse that he killed a woman nearly 40 years ago, according to City of Madison police call logs.</p> <p>At "8:01 pm., a nurse at a local hospital contacted police to report that a patient told her he was the suspect in an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime" target="_blank">unsolved murder case</a> from nearly 40 years ago in another county," the Madison police blotter says. "Officers relayed this information to the appropriate authorities."</p> <p>The victim is believed to be Terry Dolowy, a 24-year-old finance student at the University of Wisconsin who disappeared early on Valentine's Day 1985, according to the local <a href="https://www.wkow.com/video/madison-tip-in-wisconsin-1985-homicide/video_418ed63a-767b-5a42-a0ea-4a274400a318.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news outlet WKOW,</a> which spoke to the lead investigator. </p> <p>Scott Bjerkos, of the Vernon County Sheriff's Office, who has been on the case for the last 25 years, said the patient's alleged confession is not enough. </p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-cold-case-tore-apart-family-keeps-fighting-answers-nearly-40-years-later" target="_blank"><strong><u>COLD CASE TORE FAMILY APART, DROVE VICTIM'S SISTER TO SUICIDE AFTER DECADES OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS</u></strong></a></p> <p>"You have to corroborate the information that he or any individual where I'm able to link him to her death," Bjerkos told WKOW. </p> <p>He said he knew the patient "was a farmer and friend of the victim's fiancé at the time," but he did not elaborate further or say his name.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/death-potential-witness-missouri-dog-collar-captivity-case-fuels-serial-killer-speculation" target="_blank"><strong><u>DEATH OF POTENTIAL WITNESS IN DOG-COLLAR CAPTIVITY CASE FUELS SERIAL KILLER SPECULATION</u></strong></a></p> <p>What exactly the hospital patient told the nurse or why he allegedly confessed remains unknown. </p> <p>Bjerkos and Madison police did not return Fox News Digital's calls and emails with questions, and the Vernon County Sheriff's Office declined to answer questions, saying it "remains an active investigation."</p> <p>"No comments will be forthcoming in keeping with standard practice for active investigations," Vernon County and La Crosse County sheriffs Roy Torgerson and John Siegel said in a joint email statement.</p> <p>Dolowy's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/cold-case" target="_blank">cold case</a> is as puzzling as it is gruesome. </p> <p>Four days after her fiancé, Russell "Whitey" Lee, reported her missing, investigators from the Vernon County Sheriff's Office found her decapitated and charred remains when they responded to a call about a burning body.</p> <p>Her head and her dog were never found.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/video-shows-1982-tylenol-murders-suspects-relaxed-calls-cops-stupid-missing-big-blunder" target="_blank"><strong><u>VIDEO SHOWS 1982 TYLENOL MURDERS SUSPECT RELAXED AS HE CALLS COPS ‘STUPID’ FOR MISSING ‘BIG BLUNDER’</u></strong></a></p> <p>The last time she was seen alive was around 12:30 a.m. on Feb. 14, 1985, at her trailer home near Barre Mills, Wisconsin. </p> <p>She had recently arrived home from work as a bar manager at Piggy's restaurant in La Crosse when <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/missing-persons" target="_blank">she vanished</a>. </p> <p>She left behind her purse and other personal items, did not have her car and her dog was missing, according to Vernon County Sheriff's <a href="https://cms8.revize.com/revize/vernonwi/sheriff/Dolowy%20Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">summary notes</a> about the case, which also said Doloway confided in friends that she did not plan to marry Lee.</p> <p>He was supposedly known to have a gambling and a "possible" drug problem, which was part of the animosity in their relationship that appeared to be ending, the sheriff's office's notes say.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/who-is-elizabeth-thomas-kidnapping-survivor-breaks-years-silence-horror-filled-cross-country-trek" target="_blank"><strong><u>KIDNAPPING SURVIVOR ELIZABETH THOMAS BREAKS YEARS OF SILENCE ON HORROR-FILLED CROSS-COUNTRY TREK</u></strong></a></p> <p>However, DNA found on her corpse ruled out her fiancé, and the only other key piece of evidence left behind was a paint chip from a car that investigators found in a sheet wrapped around the victim. </p> <p>The paint chip was located by the crime lab and subsequently analyzed and identified as being an aftermarket paint belonging to a specific year and make of vehicle, which was never found, the sheriff's notes say.</p> <p>Nonetheless, investigators narrowed down the possibilities to ’75 GM products, ’77 Cadillacs, ’75 Buicks and Oldsmobiles, ’66 – ‘74 Toyotas, ’75 Pontiacs or ’75 Chevrolets.</p> <p>"It is thought that the paint was possibly from the trunk of a vehicle that the body was transported in," according to the sheriff's office's notes. </p> <p>The records and reports were put in digital format in 2003, and spreadsheets included every report that was generated during the investigation. </p></content:encoded>

<title>California lawmakers approve banning certain chemicals in foods, drinks</title>
<description>Measures banning certain chemicals in foods and drinks have been given final approval in California. Democratic Gov. Newsom now has until Oct. 14 to enact the bills into law.</description>
<content:encoded><p>California lawmakers are working through hundreds of bills before the legislative session ends on Thursday.</p> <p>If approved, the bills go to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who will have until Oct. 14 to decide whether to sign them into law, veto them or let them become law without his signature.</p> <p>The state Legislature almost never overrides a veto from the governor, no matter what political party is in charge.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-lawmakers-vote-fast-track-affordable-housing-legislative-session-nears-end" target="_blank"><strong>CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS VOTE TO FAST-TRACK AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS LEGISLATIVE SESSION NEARS END</strong></a></p> <p><strong>Chemicals In Food</strong></p> <p>Lawmakers on Tuesday voted to become the first state to ban four chemicals from processed food and drinks sold <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" target="_blank">in California</a> by 2027.</p> <p>The chemicals — red dye no. 3, potassium bromate, brominated vegetable oil and propyl paraben — are still used in popular products like Peeps, the popular marshmallow chicks most associated with Easter.</p> <p>Democratic Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, the author of the bill, said those chemicals have already been banned by the European Union and other countries because of scientific research linking them to health problems, including cancer.</p> <p>"It is unacceptable that the U.S. is so far behind the rest of the world when it comes to food safety," Gabriel said. "This bill will not ban any foods or products — it simply will require food companies to make minor modifications to their recipes."</p> <p>An earlier version of the bill would also have banned titanium dioxide, which is used in Skittles. But amendments in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate" target="_blank">state Senate</a> removed that chemical from the ban.</p> <p><strong>Disclosing Financial Risks Of Climate Change</strong></p> <p>The state Assembly approved a bill requiring companies making more than $500 million annually to disclose what financial risks climate change poses to their businesses and how they plan to address those risks.</p> <p>State Sen. Henry Stern, a Democrat from Los Angeles who introduced the legislation, said the information would be useful for individuals and lawmakers when making public and private investment decisions. The bill was changed recently to require companies to begin reporting the information in 2026, instead of 2024, and mandate that they report every other year, instead of annually.</p> <p>The changes would help make it more feasible for businesses to follow through with reporting requirements, said Anne DiGrazia, a spokesperson for Stern.</p> <p>The bill was among the biggest climate proposals in the state Legislature this year, collecting support from major companies including IKEA and Microsoft, as well as former California Air Resources Board Chair Mary D.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could approve rules requiring public companies to disclose their direct and indirect emissions, as well as how climate risk affects their business.</p> <p>The proposed California mandate would apply to more than 10,000 companies, according to Ceres, a policy group supporting it. The vote comes after the state Legislature sent another bill to Newsom that would require companies making more than $1 billion annually to report their direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-lawmakers-give-bill-final-approval-criminalize-caste-based-discrimination" target="_blank"><strong>CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS GIVE BILL FINAL APPROVAL TO CRIMINALIZE CASTE-BASED DISCRIMINATION</strong></a></p> <p><strong>Climate Change School Curriculum </strong></p> <p>The Senate passed a bill that would require schools to teach students, from first grade through high school, about the causes and effects of climate change. The bill also would mandate lessons on how to mitigate and adapt to the effects of the changing climate.</p> <p>Proponents of the bill say lessons about climate change are already a part of school curricula in other countries including Italy and New Zealand.

<title>Johnny Depp reveals who stayed loyal through his tough times: 'I will forever be in their debt'</title>
<description>Johnny Depp spoke of the relationship he has with Dior, being the face of their fragrance Sauvage, and said despite all the drama surrounding his life, the company remained loyal and true.</description>
<content:encoded><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/johnny-depp-signs-7-figure-deal-dior-defamation-trial-victory" target="_blank">Johnny Depp</a> spent several years working as the face of Dior's popular fragrance Sauvage, and last August, he and the brand inked a seven-figure deal that kept him in the role. Fresh off his victory from court where he and ex-wife Amber Heard had sued each other for defamation, Depp was estranged from Hollywood and lacking overall support.</p> <p>The "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/johnny-depp-orlando-bloom-keira-knightley-pirates-of-the-caribbean-cast-20-years-later" target="_blank">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>" star says it was the fashion house that remained the most loyal and true to him despite all the controversy. "They stuck with me through every single second, and that ups the stakes quite a lot for me: they trusted me, they believed in me, and they continued. That gesture is so noble and so rare," Depp told South China Morning Post of his relationship with Dior.</p> <p>"I’ve never been more touched or prouder to have had that support. Nobody does that, and the fact that Dior has, I thank every single person involved in making the decision to trust me and stick with me all the way from the bottom to the top and back down."</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/johnny-depp-felt-boycotted-amber-heard-trial-no-need-hollywood" target="_blank"><strong>JOHNNY DEPP ADMITS HE FELT BOYCOTTED AFTER AMBER HEARD DRAMA, HAS NO 'FURTHER NEED' FOR HOLLYWOOD</strong></a></p> <p>"I will forever be in their debt, I will forever be loyal. They are … man, it’s Dior! Of course, they’re a class act, but they’re actually truly a class act. I mean, that’s strength, that’s class, that’s brave, it’s courageous. Dior will always mean much more to me than just Sauvage," he said of his partnership with the company.</p> <p>Depp's relationship with Dior began in 2015 and continued after his divorce with Heard turned contentious. After Heard accused Depp of domestic violence, the company stopped airing his commercial for the perfume on TV; however, according to reports, he remained a Dior ambassador. </p> <p>After the ruling in Depp's defamation case the commercial returned.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p> <p>Depp has been candid about the lack of support he felt during those trying times, including from Hollywood.</p> <p>While attending the Cannes Film Festival this spring, Depp was questioned at length by the media for the first time since his trial concluded. He was quick to answer if he had felt <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/cancel-culture" target="_blank">boycotted by the industry</a> that made him a star.</p> <p>"Did I feel boycotted by Hollywood? Well, you’d have to not have a pulse to feel at that point like this was all just a weird joke," he said during a press conference to promote his film "Jeanne du Barry," per The Hollywood Reporter.</p> <p>"Of course, when you’re asked to resign from a film you’re doing because of something that’s merely a bunch of vowels and consonants floating in the air… Do I feel boycotted now? No, not at all. But I don’t feel boycotted because I don’t think about Hollywood. I don’t feel much further need for Hollywood — I don’t know about you."</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS</strong></a></p> <p>During the press conference, Depp also acknowledged the way in which he had been portrayed in the media, stating, "The majority of you who have been reading for the last five or six years, with regards to me and my life — the majority of what you’ve read is fantastically, horrifically written fiction. The fact is, we’re here to talk about the film. But it’s like asking the question, ‘How are you doing?’ But what’s underneath in the subtext is, ‘God, I hate you.’ That’s the sort of media thing."</p> <p>Although their relationship started years earlier, Depp and Heard were married in 2015 and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/amber-heard-files-for-divorce-from-johnny-depp" target="_blank">filed for divorce</a> in 2016.</p></content:encoded>

<title>RFK Jr urges Biden to debate, prove to voters that 'unelected people' aren't running White House</title>
<description>Robert Kennedy Jr, who’s primary challenging President Biden for the 2024 Democratic nomination, questions whether Biden has the &apos;vigor&apos; to handle his &apos;very rigorous&apos; White House duties</description>
<content:encoded><p>Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is questioning whether <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden" target="_blank">President Biden</a> has the "vigor" to handle the "very rigorous job" of president of the United States.</p> <p>In an interview with Fox News Digital, the long-shot <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6336838822112" target="_blank">Democratic presidential primary challenger</a> urged the 80-year-old Biden to hold "unscripted meetings and interactions with voters" so Americans can determine if the president "is up to the job."</p> <p>Biden has faced questions and concerns over his age ever since he made history in 2020 when he became the oldest person ever elected president. If the president wins re-election next year, he would be 82 at his second inauguration and 86 at the end of his second term.</p> <p>Polls have long indicated that Americans have concerns over Biden's age. The most recent survey on the issue from CNN indicated that roughly three-quarters of Americans said they were seriously concerned that the president's age might negatively affect his current level of physical and mental competence and his ability to serve out another full four-year term if re-elected.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-hauls-in-6-million-since-launching-democratic-primary-challenge-against-biden" target="_blank"><strong>RFK JR. HAULS IN OVER $6 MILLION SINCE LAUNCHING DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY CHALLENGE AGAINST PRESIDENT BIDEN</strong></a></p> <p>Republican presidential contenders have repeatedly questioned Biden over his age.</p> <p>GOP White House candidate and Florida <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ron-desantis" target="_blank">Gov. Ron DeSantis</a> said Tuesday in a CBS News interview that "I think that’s absolutely a legitimate concern. The presidency's not a job for someone that’s 80 years old." </p> <p>Now, it appears the 69-year-old Kennedy is taking a page from the same political playbook.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-woody-harrelson-off-grid-may-be-unaware-rfk-jr-cap-controversy" target="_blank"><strong>WHAT KENNEDY TOLD FOX NEWS ABOUT SUPPORT FROM WOODY HARRELSON</strong></a></p> <p>"A lot of people will say that ‘well President Biden is surrounded by very good people who will run the country even if he can’t,’ but I don’t think that’s a good way for democracy to work," Kennedy told Fox News on Tuesday.</p> <p>The environmental lawyer, high-profile vaccine critic, and a scion of arguably the nation’s most famous political dynasty, raised concerns that "unelected people in lanyards are going to be making critical decisions in a very, very difficult time in our history."</p> <p>"It’s important for the American people to know that their president has the vigor to handle this very rigorous job and I think there are enough doubts about that now that President Biden really needs to come out and have an unscripted meetings and interactions with voters, that he needs to do some town halls and retail politics and hopefully a debate so that the American people can make a choice about whether or not the president is up to the job," Kennedy said.</p> <p>Kennedy spotlighted concerns over Biden's age after being asked about comments he made in an interview last week when he said people should be voting for "a president who we expect to complete the term."</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-dem-challenger-rfk-jr-major-complaint-about-how-mainstream-media-covering-2024" target="_blank"><strong>ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. TAKES AIM AT MAINSTREAM MEDIA </strong></a></p> <p>A national Democratic strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, took aim at Kennedy, sarcastically telling Fox News that it's "absolutely shocking that the pro-Russia, pro-gun, anti-vaxxer candidate pretending to be a Democrat is parroting the same tired, worn out Republican talking points. Give me a break."</p> <p>Kennedy was interviewed ahead of a campaign event with voters at Robie's General Store in Hooksett, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-hampshire" target="_blank">New Hampshire</a>, which has long been a must stop in the early voting state by White House contenders.</p> <p>The candidate reiterated his claims that he's not getting a fair shake from the Democratic National Committee (DNC).</p> <p>"The DNC’s own rules say that they have to be neutral during the election but they are very open about having abandoned their neutrality and they’ve made a series of rules that make it almost — if those rules continue — it makes it almost impossible for anybody except Joe Biden to win the primary process," Kennedy charged.</p> <p>And he repeated his argument that the DNC is "disenfranchising the Democratic voters" in the primary process.</p> <p>"We live in a time when a lot of people believe the system is rigged, that democracy is no longer functioning," Kennedy warned. </p> <p>He urged that "the Democratic Party ought to be a temple for Democracy. It ought to be role modeling democracy. Most Americans assume that the candidate who wins should be the candidate who gets the most votes and that we should have rules that actually reflect that assumption."</p> <p>Kennedy's concerns with the DNC center on its often at odds roles of being the impartial referee of the presidential nominating process while at the same time following longstanding tradition and precedent of both major national party committees in endorsing and supporting a sitting president's re-election campaign. </p> <p>The candidate's complaints about a Democratic nomination process that favors the president have been coupled in recent days with what appear to be unfounded election rigging allegations against the DNC </p> <p>DNC Chair Jaime Harrison responded to Kennedy's allegations in a letter obtained Tuesday by Fox News.</p> <p>Harrison wrote that it "is clear that there are serious misunderstandings of the Democratic nominating process that are important to correct."</p> <p>"I am hopeful that a meeting with our Delegate Selection leadership team will prevent future instances of voters receiving erroneous information that could cause confusion about the equity of the Democratic nominating process," the DNC chair added.</p> <p>The latest polls in the Democratic presidential nomination race indicate that Kennedy and fellow primary challenger Marianne Williamson face steep uphill climbs against Biden.</p> <p>But Kennedy does appear to be gaining some support among independent voters, Libertarians, and even some Republicans.</p> <p>Asked if he would consider a third party White House run if he doesn't succeed in the race for the Democratic nomination, Kenney said: "we are hoping that I could run in the Democratic Party and at this point that’s the plan."</p> <p>Kennedy reiterated that when it comes to the Democratic nomination race, "I’m very confident that if I’m given a fair shot, that I’m going to win."</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/elections" target="_blank"><i><strong>Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p></content:encoded>

<title>Putin criticizes Trump arrest, trial: 'Shows the rottenness of the American system'</title>
<description>Russian President Vladimir Putin called the arrest and trial of former President Trump &quot;a politically motivated persecution.&quot;</description>
<content:encoded><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin" target="_blank">Russian President Vladimir Putin</a> questioned the arrest and trial of former President Trump, calling it a display of corruption.</p> <p>Putin made the comments Tuesday in a keynote address at the Eastern Economic Forum in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia" target="_blank">Vladivostok, Russia</a>, an annual conference.</p> <p>"As for the persecution of Trump — for us, in the current environment — it's good because it shows the rottenness of the American system," Putin told the Russian audience. "It is a politically motivated persecution of one's competitor."</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-files-motion-recuse-dc-judge-presiding-2020-election-interference-case" target="_blank"><strong>TRUMP FILE MOTION TO RECUSE DC JUDGE PRESIDING OVER 2020 ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE</strong></a></p> <p>"And this shows who we are fighting," the Russian president continued. "As they said in Soviet times: 'the bestial face of American capitalism.'"</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank">Trump has been charged</a> by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis with one count of violating the Georgia RICO Act, three counts of criminal solicitation, six counts of criminal conspiracy, one count of filing false documents and two counts of making false statements.</p> <p>Trump has pleaded not guilty to all counts. </p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/vladimir-putin-greets-north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-eastern-russia-planned-meeting" target="_blank"><strong>VLADIMIR PUTIN GREETS NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN IN EASTERN RUSSIA FOR PLANNED MEETING</strong></a></p> <p>Putin has been known to harass, attack and even kill his political enemies throughout his career and time in office.</p> <p>While the Russian government refuses to acknowledge its frequent assassination of political enemies, the Kremlin makes little effort to cover its tracks.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-sentenced-19-years-prison" target="_blank">Alexei Navalny</a> — one of Putin's most public and vocal critics — is currently imprisoned in a penal colony east of Moscow for a 30-year stint on what many analysts claim are trumped-up charges.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-files-motions-to-quash-fulton-county-indictment" target="_blank"><strong>TRUMP FILES MOTIONS TO QUASH FULTON COUNTY INDICTMENT</strong></a></p> <p>Wagner Group mercenary leader <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-not-planning-attend-prigozhin-funeral" target="_blank">Yevgeny Prigozhin</a> — who launched a short-lived coup against Putin earlier this year — was aboard an airplane that exploded in Russian airspace last month.</p> <p>Putin denied any involvement in the disaster and expressed surprise at the death of his political enemy — but Russian leaders told international authorities that they would not be moving forward with a proposed U.N. investigation into the crash.</p> <p>For over a decade, the Russian president has utilized Russian spy networks and government operatives to assassinate political opposition, foreign intelligence assets, and critics of his regime. </p> <p>Others have been jailed, disappeared from public record, or ostensibly committed suicide under mysterious circumstances.</p> <p>"With Putin, I have a very good relationship. I mean, I haven't spoken to him in a long while, but I had a very strong relationship," Trump said earlier this year when asked how he would end the Russian invasion of Ukraine within 24 hours, as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/vladimir-putin-knew-not-mess-trump-ukraine-war-biden" target="_blank"><u>he has stated on numerous occasions</u></a>. </p> <p>When asked about the invasion, the former president said of Putin, "He wouldn't have done it if it were me. He did it after I left."</p></content:encoded>

<title>North Korea fires 2 ballistic missiles toward eastern seas as leader Kim Jong Un visits Putin</title>
<description>Kim Jong Un has been using Russia’s war in Ukraine as a distraction to ramp up the country’s weaponry. On Wednesday, North Korea launched two missiles toward the Sea of Japan.</description>
<content:encoded><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/north-korea" target="_blank">North Korea</a> fired two short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern seas Wednesday, its neighbors said.</p> <p>The launch came as North Korean leader <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kim-jong-un" target="_blank">Kim Jong Un</a> was traveling in Russia for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin while there are international concerns about a potential arms deal that could fuel Moscow’s war efforts in Ukraine.</p> <p>South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected the missiles being fired 10 minutes apart from an area in Sunan, the site of Pyongyang’s international airport, and that the weapons flew cross-country toward the country’s eastern seas. It didn’t immediately say how far the weapons flew.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-arrives-russia-ahead-meeting-vladimir-putin" target="_blank"><strong><u>NORTH KOREA’S KIM JONG UN ARRIVES IN RUSSIA AHEAD OF MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN</u></strong></a></p> <p>Japan's Coast Guard, citing Tokyo's Defense Ministry, said the missile likely has landed but still urged vessels around the Japanese coasts to watch out for falling objects.</p> <p>Kim has been using the international distraction caused by Russia's war in Ukraine to ramp up the North’s weapons development, a process that has included more than 100 missile launches since the start of 2022.</p> <p>According to U.S. officials, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin" target="_blank">Putin could use his meeting</a> with Kim to secure more supplies of North Korean artillery and other ammunition to refill declining reserves and prolong his invasion of Ukraine. Experts say Kim in return could seek badly needed economic aid and sophisticated weapons technologies to advance his nuclear-weapons and missiles program.</p></content:encoded>

<title>Man, 74, pushed onto New York City subway tracks in apparent unprovoked attack</title>
<description>A 74-year-old man has suffered multiple injuries this week in New York City after being pushed onto the tracks at a subway station in Manhattan, police say.</description>

<title>Zach Wilson's mom expresses her displeasure after Jets QB gets hit with water bottle</title>
<description>The mother of New York Jets quarterback Zach Wilson was unhappy after a video surfaced of a fan at MetLife Stadium hitting him with a water bottle.</description>
<content:encoded><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-jets" target="_blank">New York Jets</a> quarterback Zach Wilson had a water bottle thrown at him as he walked off of the field at MetLife Stadium Monday night following the team’s overtime win against the Buffalo Bills.</p> <p>His mother, Lisa, was not happy about it.</p> <p>The bottle incident was shown during Scott Van Pelt’s portion of the postgame show on ESPN after the "Monday Night Football" broadcast. Wilson had a touchdown pass in the win, as he was thrust into the game following <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jets-head-coach-dismisses-notion-metlife-stadium-turf-caused-aaron-rodgers-injury" target="_blank">Aaron Rodgers’ injury</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</u></strong></a></p> <p>Lisa Wilson went on her Instagram Stories to express her displeasure.</p> <p>"That happened after they won the game," she wrote. "Hit him right in the head. Awesome."</p> <p>Lisa Wilson recapped the night from her car earlier in the day. She said she did not expect her son to be put into the game and was thankful for having a superstar like Rodgers to help guide her son.</p> <p>"I thought this was going to be a year of development and growing and learning and we were all going to get to sit and watch this amazing connection that Zach and Aaron have, which Aaron has been so, so good to Zach, and he has been just really such an amazing support and just holding his hand through all of it, and he’s been learning so much and that quickly came to an end," she said.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-legend-joe-theismann-talks-aaron-rodgers-injury-zach-wilsons-chance-to-shine" target="_blank"><strong>NFL LEGEND JOE THEISMANN TALKS AARON RODGERS INJURY, ZACH WILSON'S CHANCE TO SHINE</strong></a></p> <p>"My heart breaks for Aaron because I know how much he loves this game and Zach went in there like literally he hadn’t really played all week and he had to get up and he had to do it and he had to play hard and I am so, so proud of him."</p> <p>Lisa Wilson added that being a mother of athletes was "really stressful."</p> <p>"The bottom line is our main job as a mother, as a parent, is to support them and to love them and to comfort them and let them know that no matter what, they have a No. 1 fan."</p> <p>Jets head coach <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jets-robert-saleh-questions-doubters-writing-teams-obituary-amid-aaron-rodgers-injury" target="_blank">Robert Saleh</a> said Wilson will be the starting quarterback moving forward despite swirling rumors of the team looking to add a veteran to the roster.</p> <p>"We are going to look through some things, but I do want to make it very clear: Zach’s our quarterback," Saleh said. "We’ve got a lot of faith in Zach. We’re really excited about his opportunity, but we’re rolling with Zach and excited for this and excited for him."</p> <p>Rodgers is out for the season with a torn Achilles tendon.</p> <p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p></content:encoded>

<title>Former NYPD Commissioner Howard Safir – who led historic decrease in crime – dead at 81</title>
<description>Former New York City Police Commissioner Howard Safir, whose four-year tenure in the late 1990s included sharp declines in the city’s murder tolls, has died.</description>
<content:encoded><p>Former <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-formally-names-edward-caban-new-nypd-commissioner" target="_blank">NYPD Commissioner</a> Howard Safir – who oversaw a historic decrease in crime in the late 1990s and left an indelible mark on the nation’s largest police force – died in Annapolis, Maryland, on Monday. He was 81.</p> <p>Safir, a Bronx, New York, native with a decadeslong career in law enforcement, was named the city’s top cop by then-<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-turn-social-media-mock-rudy-giuliani-mugshot-should-we-blast-everywhere" target="_blank">Mayor Rudy Giuliani</a> in 1996, and served until 2000 – establishing the NYPD’s Courtesy, Professionalism &amp; Respect program, a motto that is still painted on the side of every police vehicle to this day.</p> <p>"A public servant for more than three decades, Commissioner Safir dedicated his professional life to improving the lives of others," said current NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nyc-cut-overtime-pay-police-being-understaffed-thousands" target="_blank"><strong>NYC TO CUT OVERTIME PAY FOR POLICE DESPITE BEING UNDERSTAFFED BY 'THOUSANDS'</strong></a></p> <p>Safir was "a devoted, dynamic leader whose pioneering work in fugitive apprehension, illicit drug enforcement, and officer training is still emulated today," Caban said.</p> <p>"This noblest of pursuits guided him throughout – and on behalf of the entire New York City Police Department and all the people we serve, I extend our sincere condolences and deepest sympathies to his family and loved ones," he added.</p> <p>Born Feb. 24, 1942 to George Safir and Rose (Weiner) Safir, the public servant embarked on his law enforcement career in 1965 as a federal narcotics agent in New York, and later did a stint working undercover for the then-newly established Drug Enforcement Administration, before taking on leadership positions with the U.S. Marshals.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-mom-blames-nypd-society-son-accused-assaulting-cop-during-influencer-sparked-melee" target="_blank"><strong>NEW YORK MOM BLAMES NYPD, 'SOCIETY' AFTER SON ACCUSED OF ASSAULTING COP DURING INFLUENCER-SPARKED MELEE</strong></a></p> <p>Prior to serving as New York City’s 39th <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/nypd-commissioner-resigns-battling-city-bureaucracy-day-1-experts" target="_blank">police commissioner</a>, he led the FDNY from 1994 to 1996, here was described as reserved, but dedicated.</p> <p>"Commissioner Safir embodies why each of us are here; to serve," NYPD Ret.

<title>Convicted killer Danelo Cavalcante captured in Pennsylvania nearly 2 weeks after prison escape</title>
<description>Law enforcement in Pennsylvania swarmed and captured Danelo Cavalcante after he escaped from prison nearly two weeks ago, state police said Wednesday.</description>
<content:encoded><p>Danelo Cavalcante has been captured alive <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania" target="_blank">in Pennsylvania</a> after he escaped from Chester County Prison and eluded authorities for nearly two weeks, state police announced Wednesday morning.</p> <p>Cavalcante was surrounded and taken by surprise in northern Chester County shortly after 8 a.m., <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank">Pennsylvania State Police</a> Lt. Col. George Bivens said during a press conference. Gov. Josh Shapiro told reporters that not a single shot was fired.</p> <p>An aircraft using thermal technology led tactical teams of State Police and U.S. Border agents to the fugitive's location around 1 a.m., but a storm with severe lightning prevented Cavalcante's immediate capture, Bivens said. The teams kept the location surrounded to prevent his escape until they were able to converge.</p> <p>When the teams moved in, Cavalcante tried to escape, crawling through thick brush, Bivens said. Authorities released a dog that ultimately subdued the prison escapee.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/escaped-killer-shot-pennsylvania-homeowner-while-run-police-say" target="_blank"><strong><u>ESCAPED KILLER SHOT AT BY PENNSYLVANIA HOMEOWNER WHILE ON THE RUN, POLICE SAY</u></strong></a></p> <p>Cavalcante was treated for a minor bite wound. No officers were injured during the capture.</p> <p>The U.S. Customs and Border Protection members were BORTAC agents, an elite Border Patrol unit based in El Paso that are skilled at apprehension and played a critical role in the capture of the escaped inmates in the Dannemora prison break in New York in 2015 as well as bringing a mass shooter in Cleveland, Texas into custody earlier this year.</p> <p>Swarms of heavily armed police were seen holding a perimeter in the South Coventry Township area late Tuesday into Wednesday.</p> <p>State police and U.S. Border Patrol teams caught Cavalcante near the home where he stole a .22-caliber rifle with a mounted scope and flashlight from an open garage on Monday night, a law enforcement source told Fox News. Cavalcante had fled from the homeowner, who shot at the escapee with his pistol and missed.</p> <p>Pennsylvania State Police had warned residents to stay inside, lock their doors and secure their cars. Officials had said Cavalcante was armed and "extremely dangerous."</p> <p>Over 500 law enforcement officers from state, local and federal agencies were involved in the search for Cavalcante. Much of the search covered difficult, wooded terrain.</p> <p>The manhunt forced several school districts to close for multiple days as residents remained on edge.</p> <p>Cavalcante, 34, broke out of a Chester County facility Aug. 31. Officials said the corrections officer on duty in the watchtower at the time of Cavalcante's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/pennsylvania-prison-guard-missed-killer-danelo-cavalcantes-escape-fired" target="_blank">escape was fired.</a></p> <p>Officials released video of Cavalcante's escape last week, showing the convicted killer crab-walking up a wall. Officials say he then pushed through razor wire, ran across the roof, scaled another fence and pushed through more razor wire before leaving the prison.</p> <p>Cavalcante was awaiting transfer to a state prison to serve a life sentence for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide" target="_blank"><u>fatally stabbing</u></a> an ex-girlfriend 38 times in front of her children in 2021. He was also wanted for killing a man in Brazil in 2017 over a debt the victim owed him for repairing a vehicle. He was allegedly in the U.S. illegally.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local" target="_blank">Chester County Commissioners</a> Marian Moskowitz, Josh Maxwell and Michelle Kichline released a joint statement following the end of the "nightmare" manhunt, saying that immediate changes have been made to the Chester County Prison. </p> <p>"Chester County Prison officials have made some immediate changes to bolster security in the prison, have brought in security contractors to make permanent changes to the exercise yards, and are reviewing and - where needed - changing procedures for both security measures and communication to residents who live close to the prison," the statement read.</p> <p>The commissioners also thanked law enforcement, the community, businesses and school districts for their support through the search.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/pennsylvania-killer-danelo-cavalcantes-sister-arrested-ice-escapee-tries-contact-former-coworkers" target="_blank"><strong>PENNSYLVANIA KILLER DANELO CAVALCANTE'S SISTER ARRESTED BY ICE; ESCAPEE TRIED TO CONTACT FORMER CO-WORKERS</strong></a></p> <p>His sister, Eleni Cavalcante, was arrested by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration" target="_blank">U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> and faces possible deportation over "some immigration issues," police said Sunday, adding that she was not cooperating with authorities in the search.</p> <p>During the manhunt, authorities had broadcast a message via helicopter from Cavalcante's mother, Iracema Cavalcante, pleading her son to surrender.</p> <p>Iracema Cavalcante spoke to The New York Times on Tuesday from her home in rural Brazil, saying her son’s life of hardship in the backlands of the Brazilian savanna trained him to survive alone as he has continually <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/manhunt" target="_blank">slipped past authorities </a>in wooded areas and small towns since escaping.</p> <p>While Iracema Cavalcante did not dispute her son’s guilt in the murders of his ex-girlfriend in Pennsylvania in 2021 or of a man in Brazil in 2017, she said he may be better off dying than spending the rest of his life in prison.</p> <p>"If it’s to go to a place to suffer and die in that place, it’s better to die soon," she told the newspaper. "You don’t have to suffer so much, just to die later."</p> <p><i>This is a breaking news story; check back for updates.</i></p></content:encoded>

<title>Hundreds of prisoners in Bahrain suspend monthlong hunger strike as crown prince visits US</title>
<description>Hundreds of Bahraini inmates have suspended their monthlong hunger strike in hopes that their crown prince will fulfill promises of change during a trip to the U.S.</description>
<content:encoded><p>Hundreds of prisoners suspended their monthlong hunger strike in Bahrain, an advocacy group said Tuesday, just ahead of a visit of the island nation's crown prince to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us" target="_blank">United States</a>.</p> <p>The strike will pause until Sept. 30 as some prisoners suffered health problems and to see if promised changes by Bahrain's government at the Jaw Rehabilitation and Reform Center will materialize, according to the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, an advocacy group.</p> <p>The promised changes include limiting isolation, expanding visitor rights, extending the hours of daylight inmates have and improving health care at the prison, the group said. If the changes are not implemented, the strike will resume.,</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/middle-east/lebanon" target="_blank"><strong><u>CLASHES RESUME BETWEEN PALESTINIAN FACTIONS IN LEBANON’S LARGEST PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMP</u></strong></a></p> <p>The group linked the decision to Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa's visit to Washington this week. He is scheduled to meet Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday and sign a security and economic agreement.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/middle-east" target="_blank">Bahrain's government</a> acknowledged the stop of the hunger strike in a statement to The Associated Press, though it contended the strike had fully ended after spending weeks trying to downplay the protest and the number of prisoners taking part. It said that the suspension came after "visiting hours were reorganized, the hours of open air access were increased and the number of contacts that could be contacted was increased too."</p> <p>The monthlong hunger strike had been one of the longest sustained demonstrations of dissent in the decade since Bahrain, aided by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, violently suppressed its 2011 Arab Spring protests.</p> <p>Maryam al-Khawaja, the daughter of the long-detained human rights activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, plans to travel to Bahrain in the coming days with activists including the head of Amnesty International. She plans to advocate for her father's release, though she herself <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/crime" target="_blank">faces prison time</a> in Bahrain, the home of the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet off the coast of Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf.</p></content:encoded>

<title>Syrians attempting to illegally enter Lebanon injured in land mine explosion</title>
<description>At least three Syrians, who may have been trying to flee from their war-torn country, became injured Wednesday when two land mines exploded along the Lebanese border.</description>
<content:encoded><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/terror/bombings" target="_blank">Two land mines exploded</a> early Wednesday along the Lebanon-Syria border wounding three Syrians trying to illegally cross into Lebanon, the Lebanese army said in a statement Wednesday.</p> <p>The army said the mines exploded on the Syrian side of the border and that the wounded were rushed by the Lebanese Red Cross to a hospital in northern Lebanon for treatment.</p> <p>Over the past months, thousands of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/syria" target="_blank">Syrian citizens</a> fleeing worsening economic conditions in their war-torn country made it to Lebanon through illegal crossing points seeking a better life. But Lebanon is going through its own four-year meltdown, with a drowning economy — pinning its hopes on tourism — and crumbling infrastructure where electricity and water cuts are widespread.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/germany-arrests-2-syrians-suspected-extremist-ties-war-crimes-one-linked-2013-attack" target="_blank"><strong>GERMANY ARRESTS 2 SYRIANS SUSPECTED OF EXTREMIST TIES AND WAR CRIMES, ONE LINKED TO 2013 ATTACK</strong></a></p> <p>The local Al-Jadeed TV said one of the victims, an 18-year-old, lost a leg and an arm, and suffered shrapnel wounds in the neck leaving him in critical condition. Another young man also lost his leg while the third, a 27-year-old, suffered some shrapnel wounds in the back.</p> <p>The Lebanese army said in a statement Tuesday that it prevented 1,250 Syrians from crossing into Lebanon this week alone. It said another 1,200 Syrians were prevented from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/middle-east/lebanon" target="_blank">reaching Lebanon</a> the previous week.</p> <p>Lebanon hosts some 805,000 United Nations-registered Syrian refugees, but officials estimate the actual number to be between 1.5 million and 2 million.</p> <p>Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati warned last week that thousands of Syrian refugees who have been coming to Lebanon over the past months, " could create harsh imbalances" in the small Mediterranean nation.</p></content:encoded>

<title>Novak Djokovic says he was never 'anti-vax': 'I was always pro-freedom to choose'</title>
<description>Novak Djokovic talked to John McEnroe about his vaccine stance and said he was never &quot;anti-vax&quot; but he was &quot;pro-freedom.&quot; Djokovic won the US Open.</description>

He was able to play at the Australian Open this year after getting deported from the country in 2022. He won the tournament.

<title>Mosquitos, feared for spreading dengue, now being bred to fight the disease</title>
<description>Modified mosquitos carrying bacteria meant to interrupt the transmission of dengue have been released in Honduras, where 10,000 people are known to be sickened by the disease each year.</description>
<content:encoded><p>For decades, preventing dengue fever in Honduras has meant teaching people to fear mosquitoes and avoid their bites. Now, Hondurans are being educated about a potentially more effective way to control the disease — and it goes against everything they’ve learned.</p> <p>Which explains why a dozen people cheered last month as Tegucigalpa resident Hector Enriquez held a glass jar filled with mosquitoes above his head, and then freed the buzzing insects into the air. Enriquez, a 52-year-old mason, had volunteered to help publicize a plan to suppress dengue by releasing millions of special mosquitoes in the Honduran capital.</p> <p>The mosquitoes Enriquez unleashed in his El Manchen neighborhood — an area rife with dengue — were bred by scientists to carry bacteria called Wolbachia that interrupt transmission of the disease. When these mosquitoes reproduce, they pass the bacteria to their offspring, reducing future outbreaks.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/dengue-virus-spreads-florida-counties-health-officials" target="_blank"><strong>DENGUE VIRUS SPREADS ACROSS FLORIDA COUNTIES, HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY</strong></a></p> <p>This emerging strategy for battling dengue was pioneered over the last decade by the nonprofit World Mosquito Program, and it is being tested in more than a dozen countries. With more than half the world’s population at risk of contracting dengue, the World Health Organization is paying close attention to the mosquito releases <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/latin-america" target="_blank">in Honduras</a>, and elsewhere, and it is poised to promote the strategy globally.</p> <p>In Honduras, where 10,000 people are known to be sickened by dengue each year, Doctors Without Borders is partnering with the mosquito program over the next six months to release close to 9 million mosquitoes carrying the Wolbachia bacteria.</p> <p>"There is a desperate need for new approaches," said Scott O’Neill, founder of the mosquito program.</p> <p>Scientists have made great strides in recent decades in reducing the threat of infectious diseases. But dengue is the exception: Its rate of infection keeps going up.</p> <p>Models estimate that around 400 million people across some 130 countries are infected each year with dengue. Mortality rates from dengue are low – an estimated 40,000 people die each year from it – but outbreaks can overwhelm health systems and force many people to miss work or school.</p> <p>"When you come down with a case of dengue fever, it’s often akin to getting the worst case of influenza you can imagine," said Conor McMeniman, a mosquito researcher at Johns Hopkins University.</p> <p>Traditional methods of preventing mosquito-borne illnesses haven’t been nearly as effective against dengue.</p> <p>The Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that most commonly spread dengue have been resistant to insecticides, which have fleeting results even in the best-case scenario. And because dengue virus comes in four different forms, it is harder to control through vaccines.</p> <p>Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are also a challenging foe because they are most active during the day – meaning that’s when they bite – so bed nets aren’t much help against them. Because these mosquitoes thrive in warm and wet environments, and in dense cities, climate change and urbanization are expected to make the fight against dengue even harder.</p> <p>The Wolbachia bacteria exist naturally in about 60% of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/insects" target="_blank">insect species</a>, just not in the Aedes aegypti mosquito.</p> <p>"We worked for years on this," said O’Neill, 61, who with help from his students in Australia eventually figured out how to transfer the bacteria from fruit flies into Aedes aegypti mosquito embryos by using microscopic glass needles.</p> <p>Since female mosquitoes pass Wolbachia to their offspring, they will eventually "replace" a local mosquito population with one that carries the virus-blocking bacteria.</p> <p>Since 2011, the World Mosquito Program has run trials affecting 11 million people across 14 countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Fiji and Vietnam.</p> <p>The results are promising. In 2019, a large-scale field trial in Indonesia showed a 76% drop in reported dengue cases after Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes were released.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/dengue-fever-cases-could-reach-near-record-highs-this-yea-what-know-tropical-infectious-disease" target="_blank"><strong><u>DENGUE FEVER CASES COULD REACH NEAR-RECORD HIGHS THIS YEAR: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE TROPICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASE</u></strong></a></p> <p>Still, questions remain about whether the replacement strategy will be effective – and cost effective – on a global scale. The three-year Tegucigalpa trial will cost $900,000, or roughly $10 per person that Doctors Without Borders expects it to protect.</p> <p>Scientists aren’t yet sure how Wolbachia actually blocks viral transmission. And it isn’t clear whether the bacteria will work equally well against all strains of the virus, or if some strains might become resistant over time, said Bobby Reiner, a mosquito researcher at the University of Washington.</p> <p>Many of the world’s mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia were hatched in a warehouse in Medellín, Colombia, where the World Mosquito Program runs a factory that breeds 30 million of them per week.</p> <p>The factory imports dried mosquito eggs from different parts of the world to ensure the specially bred mosquitoes it eventually releases will have similar qualities to local populations, including resistance to insecticides, said Edgard Boquín, one of the Honduras project leaders working for Doctors Without Borders.</p> <p>The dried eggs are placed in water with powdered food. Once they hatch, they are allowed to breed with the "mother colony" — a lineage that carries Wolbachia and is made up of more females than males.</p> <p>Once workers confirm that the new mosquitoes carry Wolbachia, their eggs are dried and filled into pill-like capsules to be sent off to release sites.</p> <p>The Doctors Without Borders team in Honduras recently went door-to-door in a hilly neighborhood of Tegucigalpa to enlist residents’ help in incubating mosquito eggs bred in the Medellin factory.</p> <p>At half a dozen houses, they received permission to hang from tree branches glass jars containing water and a mosquito egg-filled capsule. After about 10 days, the mosquitoes would hatch and fly off.</p> <p>That same day, a dozen young workers from Doctors Without Borders fanned out across Northern Tegucigalpa on motorcycles carrying jars of the already hatched <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease" target="_blank">dengue-fighting mosquitoes</a> and, at designated sites, released thousands of them into the breeze.</p> <p>Lourdes Betancourt, 63, a volunteer with the Doctors Without Borders team, encourages her neighbors to let the "good mosquitoes" grow in their yards.</p> <p>"They are going to bite you, but you won’t get dengue," she said.</p></content:encoded>

<title>Bray Wyatt's fiancée posts touching tribute to late wrestler: 'I miss the love of my life so much it hurts'</title>
<description>Bray Wyatt&apos;s fiancee JoJo Offerman wrote a heartbreaking message about the late WWE wrestler weeks after he tragically passed away at the age of 36.</description>
<content:encoded><p>The fiancée of the late <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/wwe" target="_blank">WWE wrestler</a> known as Bray Wyatt wrote a heartbreaking message on her Instagram Tuesday in the wake of his death a few weeks ago.</p> <p>Wyatt, whose real name is Windham Rotunda, died last month at the age of 36. He reportedly <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wwe-star-bray-wyatt-died-heart-attack-report" target="_blank">died of a heart attack</a> after battling an illness of the course of a few months. JoJo Offerman posted several pictures of herself and Wyatt together as well as them with their children.</p> <p>"Ive written and rewritten this post so many times because there are no amount of words in this world to describe Windham and what he means to me. But I’ve also been avoiding it because in some weird way it makes all of this all too real," she wrote.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</u></strong></a></p> <p>"I miss the love of my life so much it hurts. He was everything I ever wanted and everything I never knew I needed, and I let him know that everyday. I’m so grateful that he allowed me to love him fiercely. But I am so blessed he loved me fiercely in return. He was and always will be the best person I know, my best friend, and my soulmate. Windham truly gave me a love that will last a lifetime and oh baby I thank him for that.</p> <p>"He was the kindest, funniest, most caring man in the world. He made me feel beyond special every single day. He made everyone feel special, which was one of the million things I loved about him. Our bond was magical, something only the two of us understood. And that beautiful bond brought two perfect babies into the world."</p> <p>Offerman remembered him as the best father to his children and someone who knew her better than she knew herself.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wwe-legend-ric-flair-remembers-bray-wyatt-genius" target="_blank"><strong>WWE LEGEND RIC FLAIR REMEMBERS THE LATE BRAY WYATT: 'A GENIUS'</strong></a></p> <p>"He was the only person in the world that I could be unapologetically myself around and not only did he accept it, he loved it," she added. "I cry because I wish we had more time baby, but I smile because I was so blessed to be loved by you in the time we did have. </p> <p>"I will always love you Windham. I will always show our kids how incredible their daddy is. I will always make sure they know how much you love them. And I will always make you proud just like you made me proud. I love you forever baby, until we meet again."</p> <p>WWE paid tribute to Wyatt during their "Monday Night Raw" and "Friday Night SmackDown" shows last month.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wwe-star-known-as-bray-wyatt-dead" target="_blank">news of Wyatt’s death</a> was a devastating revelation as a report surfaced earlier this month that the former champion was nearing a return to the ring after battling a "life-threatening illness."</p> <p>Wyatt had returned to the WWE in October 2022 and was in a couple of programs but was sidelined with health issues before WrestleMania 39.</p></content:encoded>

<title>Dethroned pageant queen alleges she was raped, forced into explicit video in lawsuit against Pornhub</title>
<description>Kristy Althaus, runner-up in the 2021 Miss Teen Colorado pageant, is suing Pornhub and its parent company, MindGeek, for allowing videos from GirlsDoPorn to circulate online.</description>
<content:encoded><p>A former pageant queen is alleging she was raped and forced to film pornography in a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law" target="_blank">new lawsuit against Pornhub</a> and its parent company, MindGeek, which changed its name to Aylo in August.</p> <p>Kristy Althaus, runner-up in the 2021 Miss Teen Colorado pageant before her crown was revoked due to a leaked pornography video, is suing the porn giants for allowing videos from GirlsDoPorn.com, a dismantled pornography website founded by former FBI <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/missing-persons" target="_blank"><u>Most Wanted fugitive</u></a> Michael James Pratt, to circulate online.</p> <p>"Threatened, coerced, and physically and sexually assaulted, Plaintiff was forced to succumb to the demands of the GirlsDoPorn sex trafficking venture, entirely sustained by MindGeek’s vast online network," the federal lawsuit filed on Sept. 8 states.</p> <p>The lawsuit alleges that in 2013, after winning the runner-up title, Althaus pursued a paid modeling gig advertisement on Craigslist, and GirlsDoPorn flew her out to San Diego for "one photoshoot (sic)." She was 18 at the time.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/porn-site-owner-coerced-100-women-film-videos-he-said-wouldnt-posted-online-doj" target="_blank"><strong><u>PORN SITE OWNER COERCED 100 WOMEN TO FILM VIDEOS HE SAID HE WOULDN'T POST ONLINE: DOJ</u></strong></a></p> <p>"Rather than the mere headshots and clothing photoshoot (sic) that she had agreed to fly to San Diego to do, Pratt began demanding that Plaintiff film nude and sexually explicit videos. When Plaintiff refused, Pratt, now 41, and his conspirators immediately pressured her and plied her with booze and pills to soften her reluctance," the lawsuit states.</p> <p>The complaint further alleges that Pratt took Althaus' cellphone during the filming and only gave it back to her afterward.</p> <p>Pratt's GirlsDoPorn co-conspirator, Michael Isaac Wolfe, admitted to coercing about 100 "models" between the ages of 18 and 23 into making pornographic videos for their San Diego-based website, which he said would not be shared in the United States. The government shut down GirlsDoPorn in October 2019.</p> <p>Wolfe admitted to posting those videos on the U.S. website GirlsDoPorn for public viewing. He also said he trained cameraman and co-defendant Theodore Gyi on how to shoot the videos – training that included a lesson on how to tell the women in the videos that they would not be posted on the internet.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/pornhub-blocks-access-users-utah-age-verification-law" target="_blank"><strong>PORNHUB BLOCKS ACCESS TO USERS IN UTAH OVER AGE VERIFICATION LAW</strong></a></p> <p>Additionally, Wolfe admitted that Pratt also operated a website called Pornwikileaks.com with identifying information and social media accounts for some women being filmed. The website was dedicated to revealing the true identities of the women appearing in those sex videos, "causing the victims to be subjected to severe harassment," the DOJ said in a press release last year.</p> <p>Pratt, Wolfe and two other men were present while allegedly forcing Althaus to record the pornographic film in a hotel room in San Diego. Althaus was "in fear for her life" at the time, the complaint says.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/netflix-pornhub-doc-buries-troubling-allegations-sex-abuse-rape-lawsuit-attorneys-say" target="_blank"><strong>NETFLIX PORNHUB DOC BURIES TROUBLING ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE AND RAPE IN LAWSUIT, ATTORNEY SAYS</strong></a></p> <p>"Unfortunately, GirlsDoPorn had posted the first video of Plaintiff on MindGeek’s network, and the video became wildly successful. MindGeek and GirlsDoPorn generated millions of dollars from Plaintiff’s video," the complaint states. They also allegedly promoted the video by referring to Althaus as "Miss Teen Colorado" in the video.</p> <p>Althaus reportedly lost her Miss Teen Colorado runner-up crown after the video surfaced.</p> <p>Aylo, formerly MindGeek, told Fox News Digital in a statement that its "number one priority" is the "safety" of its community.</p> <p>"[W]e are proud to have instituted Trust and Safety policies that surpass those of any other major user-generated platform on the internet. Our compliance program has helped us set the standard for the tech industry, and we are committed to remaining at the forefront of this important area," Aylo said. "Out of respect for the integrity of court proceedings, our policy is not to comment on ongoing litigation. We look forward to the facts being fully and fairly aired in that forum."</p> <p>After the first video was filmed, Althaus began her first year of college. During that time, Pratt allegedly threatened and blackmailed her into filming more pornographic content for GirlsDoPorn. The lawsuit also alleges that Pratt forced Althaus to perform oral sex on him and threatened her with a gun.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/wisconsin-cop-admits-porn-addiction-busted-child-pornography-police" target="_blank"><strong>WISCONSIN COP ADMITS TO PORN ADDICTION, BUSTED WITH CHILD PORNOGRAPHY: POLICE</strong></a></p> <p>"Despite its actual or constructive knowledge that GirlsDoPorn used <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime" target="_blank">force, fraud, and coercion</a> to film young women in pornographic videos, MindGeek continued to offer its global platform, internet distribution channels, and financial lifeline to the GirlsDoPorn criminal enterprise for over a decade," Althaus' lawsuit states.</p> <p>Pratt is accused of participating in a conspiracy to recruit young women and girls to engage in commercial sex acts by use of force, fraud and coercion. He allegedly did so by telling the women and girls that they would be paid $3,000 to $5,000 for a one-day pornographic video shoot. In some instances, however, Pratt and his assistants allegedly locked women in rooms until the explicit videos were filmed and forced some women to commit sex acts that they initially declined to do, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank">according to the FBI</a>.</p> <p>According to the lawsuit, GirlsDoPorn even "went so far as to hire actresses to pose as previous models and assure new recruits of their privacy and security. These paid ‘references’ provided prospective models with false comfort that the experience was safe and enjoyable, and that the fake references’ videos had never appeared online or been discovered by anyone in the references’ lives"</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/mastercard-visa-investigate-pornhub-business-relationship-following-report" target="_blank"><strong><u>MASTERCARD, VISA INVESTIGATE PORNHUB BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP FOLLOWING REPORT</u></strong></a></p> <p>Althaus has been unable to maintain a job or healthy relationships and "has been repeatedly followed and harassed," according to the lawsuit.</p> <p>"As recently as May-June 2023, Plaintiff was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/sex-crimes" target="_blank">assaulted at her home</a> by a self-described Pornhub subscriber who confronted her about the recent removal of the subject videos from Defendants’ websites," the complaint states. "The subscriber did not act alone and was with other male individuals terrifying Plaintiff."</p> <p>"Plaintiff fears for her life and safety, as well as the lives and safety of people close to her," the complaint continues.</p> <p>Althaus is one of dozens of victims who have brought similar allegations against GirlsDoPorn and websites like Pornhub that promoted the since-closed website's content, "generated millions of dollars in revenue," the lawsuit states.</p> <p>Pratt was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/san-diego-porn-fbi-most-wanted-spain" target="_blank">arrested in Spain</a> last year after spending years on the run from law enforcement.</p> <p>MindGeek changed its named to Aylo on Aug. 17.</p> <p>"Our goal is for ‘Aylo’ to be synonymous with our core principles: innovation, diverse and inclusive adult content, and trust and safety. We wanted a fresh start, so we opted for a name that gave us that freedom, so that our team and our new owners could define it how we want," Aylo management said in a statement last month.

<title>Team Biden just made the worst deal ever with Iran</title>
<description>The Biden administration notified Congress that it had just released $6 billion of frozen assets to Iran.</description>
<content:encoded><p>On the 22nd anniversary of the worst terror attacks in America’s history, the Biden Administration notified Congress that it had just released $6 billion of frozen assets to Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terror, and would release five Iranians detained in the U.S. in exchange for five American hostages. We should all be happy for the families of these five Americans and be thankful that they are finally receiving good news about their loved ones – as Secretary of State, nothing was more rewarding than bringing home Americans held <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy" target="_blank">hostage in foreign countries</a>. </p> <p>While our goal should always be to bring every American home, we must also negotiate to ensure we don’t incentivize the taking of hostages in the future. But this is the worst deal ever. Paying for Americans wrongly detained by Iran will only make Americans less safe in the long run and provides more funding for the brutal Iranian regime. These were lessons we learned long ago, but that Joe Biden refuses to learn. </p> <p>When Team Biden first announced it was working on this swap last month, it took great pains to emphasize that Iran could only use this vast sum of money for "humanitarian" purposes, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken repeated this message in his letter to Congress this week. </p> <p>Let’s be clear: There is zero chance this money is going to benefit the Iranian people. None. Even Team Biden knows this because money is fungible. Even if every cent is used for "good" purposes to placate the population, the regime just got six billion dollars to spread terror to America, Israel, and our partners and allies. </p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION</u></strong></a></p> <p>But this is a page out of the Obama Administration’s playbook – Obama officials made similar arguments when they funneled massive amounts of taxpayer dollars to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA). Those taxpayer dollars did little more than support the rise of Hamas in Gaza and, eventually, the West Bank. This case was made again when President Obama, without Senate approval, committed America to the original Iran deal in 2015, sending pallets of American cash to the Ayatollah in an exchange involving the release of American hostages. Now that familiar faces from the Obama JV team have returned in the Biden Administration, Tehran is taking advantage of their weakness again. </p> <p>History has shown that rewarding terrorist regimes is foolish and results in bad outcomes for Americans. That’s why when I was Secretary of State, we cut off funding to the UNWRA and put a historic sanctions program in place to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran" target="_blank">cripple the Iranian regime</a>. We were able to do this and still bring home two American hostages, Xiyue Wang and Michael White, without sending Iran a dime. </p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-president-reveals-plans-spending-6-billion-gained-us-prisoner-exchange" target="_blank"><strong>IRANIAN PRESIDENT REVEALS PLANS FOR SPENDING $6 BILLION GAINED IN US PRISONER EXCHANGE</strong></a></p> <p>Instead of building on this approach, the Biden Administration made a $6 billion ransom payment. This will greatly increase Iran’s ability to fund future acts of terror and encourage the taking of more hostages. By paying $6 billion to get back five Americans, the Iranian regime knows that American hostages can now be held for billions in ransom, and so do the rest of our adversaries. After Biden decided to give Victor Bout – the "Merchant of Death" – back to Putin to bring Britney Griner home, I said that the Administration had turned the American passport into a bullseye. I fear that bullseye just grew even bigger.</p> <p>This deal looks even worse considering Iran’s recent activity. In July, the Iranian Navy attempted to seize two oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz. The Iranian regime has supplied Vladimir Putin with drones that have been used to kill both Ukrainian soldiers and civilians. The regime has continued to grow its stockpile of enriched uranium throughout Biden’s tenure, making the minor pause in this effort around the hostage deal insignificant. And the regime continues its brutal crackdown on protesters as the anniversary of Mahsa Amini’s murder approaches. By making a bad deal, the Biden Administration is rewarding Iran’s malign behavior when it should be punishing it with maximum pressure.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p> <p>The Obama and now Biden administrations maintain that rewarding the regime will result in regime change. That was their argument for the terrible 2015 Iran deal and remains their motivation today. Even Senator Chuck Schumer knew this logic was flawed and voted against the deal in 2015, saying, "I believe Iran will not change." He was right then and remains correct: Iran has not changed. And further rewarding them will not bring change in the future for the better. </p> <p>In the Trump Administration, we understood that the goal of hostage negotiations is not simply to bring Americans home, no matter the cost; it is also to protect Americans in the future. For this reason, our leaders should always be crystal clear about the consequences of holding an American hostage, even when negotiating to bring them home. This was the model we followed in the Trump Administration: When Pastor Andrew Brunson was being held in Turkey, for instance, we introduced tariffs and sanctions until the Turkish government relented and allowed him to come home. </p> <p>The Biden Administration has done the opposite. It has rewarded the Iranian regime for holding Americans hostage and has sent a message to our enemies that there is real profit in going after American citizens. And it has rewarded and helped further entrench a brutal regime that hates <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel" target="_blank">our ally Israel</a> and has no regard for human life. The Biden administration should have negotiated a better deal. Instead, it paid a ransom and made the worst deal ever.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p></content:encoded>

<title>Former NYC buildings official to turn himself in on indictment linked to Eric Adams campaign donors: reports</title>
<description>New York City Mayor Eric Adams&apos; former Department of Buildings Commissioner Eric Ulrich is expected to surrender Wednesday on sealed charges in Manhattan.</description>
<content:encoded><p>Former <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city" target="_blank">New York City</a> Department of Buildings Commissioner Eric Ulrich is expected to turn himself in on Wednesday on sealed charges brought in connection to a yearlong probe by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office reportedly linked to several campaign donors for Mayor Eric Adams. </p> <p>The charges against Ulrich do not implicate Adams or <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/elections" target="_blank">the mayor's campaign,</a> sources told Politico. Ulrich's defense attorney Sam Braverman told the New York Daily News he expects Ulrich to surrender at the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse sometime Wednesday morning and appear before Judge Daniel Conviser at 2:15 p.m.</p> <p>"I truly and honestly have no inside information as to what the charges are. Anybody who says they know are lying unless they are the DA or a grand juror. If I know what the charges are, I would comment," Braverman told Politico on Tuesday, adding that "it would be rank speculation" to comment before Ulrich turns himself in. </p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-rep-9-11-terror-hearing-blows-hole-claim-nyc-migrants-fully-vetted" target="_blank"><strong>GOP REP AT 9/11 TERROR HEARING BLOWS HOLE THROUGH CLAIM NYC MIGRANTS FULLY VETTED</strong></a></p> <p>Ulrich was charged through a sealed indictment over the summer, the New York Times first reported. </p> <p>The indictment reportedly names at least four other individuals in connection to the same investigation, including brothers Joseph and Anthony Livreri, who own two Queens pizza shops and co-hosted an August 2021 fundraiser for Adams’ mayoral campaign, according to Politico. </p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayor-eric-adams-predicts-migrant-crisis-will-destroy-new-york-city" target="_blank"><strong>MAYOR ERIC ADAMS PREDICTS MIGRANT CRISIS 'WILL DESTROY NEW YORK CITY'</strong></a></p> <p>News outlet The City first reported that the indictment also names Mark Caller, a real estate developer and another <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ericadams" target="_blank">mayoral campaign donor for Adams</a> who hosted a separate, lucrative August 2021 fundraiser for the mayor's campaign. </p> <p>In a separate case, Bragg’s office announced in July that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nyc-charges-6-straw-donor-scheme-help-elect-adams-mayor" target="_blank">six of Adams’ former campaign donors,</a> including NYPD retired deputy inspector Dwayne Montgomery, were charged in an alleged straw donor scheme to direct tens of thousands of dollars in illicit contributions to the mayor’s campaign. </p> <p>Bragg is scheduled to hold a press conference Wednesday afternoon with New York City Department of Investigation Commissioner Jocelyn Strauber in connection to Ulrich’s case, the Daily News reported. </p> <p>Ulrich resigned as the buildings commissioner last November after Bragg’s office seized his phone. He previously served on New York City Council as a Republican before switching to the Democrat Party to support Adams’ mayoral run. </p></content:encoded>
